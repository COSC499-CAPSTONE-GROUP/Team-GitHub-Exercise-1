### Feature #1: Finding Max

*Finding max* refers to finding the largest (maximum) value of a given set of numbers. To find the maximum value, all you need to do is compare all the numbers against each other, starting from the very beginning of the list. Update the maximum number every time a new number is a greater than the current max value. Continue doing so until you reach the end of the list.
